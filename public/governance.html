                        Medical Data Works's Railway service implements a privacy preserving federated infrastructure as proposed
                        by the Personal Health Train. The main principle of the Personal Health Train is to bring questions to the data rather than moving data.
                        This concept is called <b>Federated Learning</b>.

                        The Personal Health Train metaphor defines the following components:
                        <ul> 
                            <li><b>Station:</b> An information system that contains sensitve data, such as from patients. 
                            Typically a hospital or registry provides a Station.</li>
                            <li><b>Train:</b> Software that encodes a question to be asked to a Station and outputs anonymous, statistical data. 
                            Typically a university or a company provides a Train. </li>
                            <li><b>Track:</b> Software and infrastructure that allow Trains to enter Stations and ask questions.
                            Medical Data Works B.V. provides the Track. </li>

                        Medical Data Works has setup a governance framework for projects using Railway with the following principles: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency:</b>
                                A project (aka consortium or collaboration) agreement must be agreed upon by each project using Railway. 
                                This project agreement is between the organizations that provide Stations and/or Trains.
                                A template of such an agreement is provided below. 
                                The project agreement has a number of elements including
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A list of organizations involved in the project and who the leading organization is</li>
                                    <li>A list of Stations and a description of the data elements that they contain</li>
                                    <li>A description of the Trains being deployed in the project</li>
                                    <li>How GDPR or other regulations will be adhered to - see this section for GDPR specific aspects</li>
                                    <li>Intellectual property, results ownership, revenue sharing, publication, and authorship matters</li>
                                </ul> 
                                Note that Medical Data Works is typically not a party in such an agreement.
                                <br> The project agreeement ensures that only projects are conducted on Railway that all parties have agreed on.
                            </li>
                            <br><li><b>Accountability:</b> Each Station, Track and Train providing organization is responsible and accountable for its own activities.</li>
                            <br><li><b>Purpose limitation:</b> In the project agreement the goals of the project should be clearly described. The Track user agreement demands that
                                the Track is only used for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.</li>
                            <br><li><b>Data minimization:</b> In the project agreement the data elements needed for the project should be clearly described and 
                                proportional to the project goals. It is only these data elements that should be places in a Station.</li>
                            <br><li><b>Integrity & confidentialty:</b> The Personal Health Train isa privacy-by-design infrastructure.
                                Data are only processed in the Station which is inside the IT environment of the Station provider (e.g. hospital) under
                                the governance and with appropriate security measures as defined by the local IT department. Station data is typically a de-identified export 
                                of data from clinical information systems. Accidental loss of Station data can be corrected by re-exporting the data.
                                As the Track provider, Medical Data Works
                                applies a user/role based authorization combined with industry standard identification and authentication to perform tasks on the Track.

                            </li>                   
                            <br><li><b>Digital sovereignty & data control:</b> A Station or Train provider may choose their own digital solution 
                                as long as these choices do not harm interoperability between Stations and Trains. This is a matter for the project partners to decide on.
                                Medical Data Works takes no position in these matters.
                                <br>At all times will a Station be in control of their own data. The Station actively allows a Train to access its data and it can 
                                deny or revoke that access at any moment and for any reason.
                                </li>  
                            <br><li><b>Open source, open access, open standards:</b> Medical Data Works uses the open source

                        The Personal Health Train is based on Federated Learning where the question travels to the data, rather than data moving.
                        Thus no personal data is shared between parties. Only statistical, anonymous data is shared via the Track.
                        All data processing takes place in the Station. As such it is a privacy-by-design infrastructure.
                        <br><br>As data processing on personal data is taking place in any Personal Health Train project, the GDPR roles of (joint)controller
                        and processor needs to be defined and proper agreements between joint controller and/or controller and processor need to reached.
                        <br><br>Under GDPR, a controller is the legal entity that 
                        <i>"determines the purposes for which and the means by which personal data is processed.
                         So, if your company/organisation decides 'why' and 'how' the personal data should be processed it is the data controller.".</i>
                        (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/controllerprocessor/what-data-controller-or-data-processor_en">source</a>)
                        <br><br>In the case of the Personal Health Train, the Train provider is a controller as it is the legal entity 
                        asking the question ('why') and supplies the sofware ('how'). 
                        <br><br>
                        However, in Personal Health Train projects, this leads to the peculiar situation that the controller (typically a university or a company)
                        does not have or control (in the common sense) any data. The Train provider has no access to data in the Station 
                        nor does it control how it gets into the Station. Because of this, the Train provider cannot fullfill some of the responsibilities
                        that the GDPR puts on it. 
                        <br><br>Specifically the Train provider has to delegate the following responsibilities to the Stations.
                        <ul>
                            <li></li>
                            <li></li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>The Station providers have a choice  which GDPR role they assume. They have two options:
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Processor:</b> If they are not involved in defining the Train (i.e. the question being posed to the data) and are "simply" a data provider, 
                            then a role as processor seems in order. In the data processing agreement the processor needs to take on some responsibilities
                            of the controller / Train provider (see above).</li>
                        <li><b>Joint controller:</b> If they are involved in defining the Train then a role as controller seems in order. 
                            The Station provider then becomes a joint controller with the Train provider. 
                            In the joint controller agreement the responsibilities of each party needs to be defined.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The above GDPR aspects are implemented in the template project agreement given below.
                        <br>
                        Note that the Track provider (in Railway this is Medical Data Works) has no GDPR role. 
                        This is because  legal and technical measures ensure that only anonymous data is shared via the Track.
                        Anonymous data falls out of the scope of GDPR.

                        Below is a typical process for setting up the governance of a Personal Health Train project.

                        <ol type="1">

                                Define the role of each party (e.g. which parties will provide Stations, which parties will provide Trains). 
                                <br>For parties subject to GDPR: Define if the party is a (joint) controller or a data processor. 
                                Joint controller agreements and data processing agreements are annexes to the project agreement.
                                <br>Typically the reserch protocol is an annex to this agreement.
                                <br>Optionally financial, intellectual property, autorship etc. clauses are part of this agreement.
                                <br>Note that typically Medical Data Works is not a party in the project agreement.</li>
